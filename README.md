    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Seed the database with sample data
    python -m app.seed
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    - You will need your **Supabase Project URL** and **Anon Key**. Find them in your Supabase project under `Settings > API`.
    - You will also need to set up **Google OAuth** credentials from the Google Cloud Console.
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create the environment file
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    ```
    - Now, open the newly created `.env.local` file and add your Supabase and Google credentials.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    - **Terminal 1 (for Backend):**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        source venv/bin/activate
        uvicorn app.main:app --reload
        ```
        > The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

    - **Terminal 2 (for Frontend):**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run dev
        ```
        > The frontend will be live at `http://localhost:3000`
